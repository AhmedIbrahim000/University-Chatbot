Note that:
  The project is a mobile applicatiom using Flutter but since the focus here on the back-end model so i didnt upload the Flutter part, and we used flaskApi to for the app, so you can not work dierctly through an UI or cmd to try it,
  so we recommend to use any testing tool like "Postman" to get responses from the chatbot.
